# Face mask detection
This is a real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a mask or not. I will train the face mask detector model using Keras and Haar Cascade. Haar Cascade is an Object Detection Algorithm used to identify faces in an image or a real time video. The algorithm uses edge or line detection features proposed by Viola and Jones in their research paper “Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features” published in 2001. The algorithm is given a lot of positive images consisting of faces, and a lot of negative images not consisting of any face to train on them.

Algorithm which displays view of device camera works in the following steps:
1.	Capture the video frame
2.	Display the resulting frame
3.	Iterate through faces with prediction whether mask is on the face or not.
